# Authentication and Authorization
- Authentication and authorization are two vital information security processes that administrators use to protect systems and information. 
- Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights. - Authentication determines whether the person is user or not. 
- While Authorization determines What permission does the user have?
- In order to implement the authorization part, we will use JWT(JSON WEB TOKEN).
