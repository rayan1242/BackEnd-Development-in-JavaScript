**Git - VCS (Version Control System)**

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems)
Internal working - .git folder

- Manage collaborative coding environment
- Manage version (Version management System)

There are companies that implement their own VCS

eg. Google uses different VCS -> "piper" which has totally different architecture.

**GitHub**

GitHub, is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.It is commonly used to host open source software development projects.

When u do `git init` it creates a new .git folder inside your project that has all the relevant logic to manage the versions of your project and intialises a new empty repository.It powers your folders to be managed by git.

.git is a hidden folder.
