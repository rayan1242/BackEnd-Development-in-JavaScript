/*
 
You want to read a file. But u donâ€™t want to read the whole file at one go. You can read the file in the form of a stream i.e. chunk by chunk you can start reading the file and then write it.

When u are actually reading the file using a readable stream u can actually pipe the stream of data to an output stream using a writable stream. U can actually pipe the content that means whatever flow of content is coming from the read pipeline u are just piping it out to the write pipeline.
